less:fix CVE-2014-9488

I stumbled over an invalid memory access in less a while ago:
https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/3-less-out-of-bounds-read-access-TFPA-0022014.html

While I never got a reply from the less developers it seems with
version 475 they finally fixed it. They don't have any release
announcements or public repositories, but there is a mentioning in the
file version.c probably related:
+v475  3/2/15    Fix possible buffer overrun with invalid UTF-8; 
+                fix bug when compiled with no regex; fix non-match
  search.

This is likely the change that fixes this bug (but I haven't verified
that, there are multiple things changed between 474 and 475):
